My name is Nico Lang and I have been a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) since 2018. I am working in the [EcoVision Lab](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/ecovision.html) that is part of the [Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (PRS) group](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Konrad Schindler](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=143986) and [Prof. Jan Dirk Wegner](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=186562). 

**Research**\
My research interests are in the area of computer vision, machine learning, and remote sensing and in developing new methods using these techniques to support environmental sciences. My Phd research focuses on advancing the way we measure forest structure at global scales using publicly available satellite data. My interests also include uncertainty estimation in deep learning and learning from imbalanced data, as these are omnipresent challenges that arise when working on real-world problems. I see great potential in the application of machine learning to address global environmental issues. 

**Studies**\
During my Bachelor's degree in Geomatics and Planning at ETH Zurich, I discovered my fascination for machine learning and computer vision in the context of geospatial data science. Before continuing with my [Master in Geomatics at ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/architecture-and-civil-engineering/geomatics.html), I started an internship in computer vision at [upicto](https://www.venturelab.swiss/Logitech-buys-ETH-spinoff-Upicto), a start-up from the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH, and continued it at Logitech, as upicto was acquired during my time there.

**Collaborations**\
Following the work started during an early academic visit to [Prof. Pietro Perona's](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Perona.html)  [Computational Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, I worked on deep learning approaches to monitor urban trees from street-level images. During my Phd I've had the chance to collaborate with the [NASA GEDI mission](https://gedi.umd.edu/), the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL](http://www.wsl.ch), as well as with companies and institutions outside academia: [Barry Callebaut](https://www.barry-callebaut.com/), [High carbon stock Approach (HCSA)](http://highcarbonstock.org/), [Hunziker, Zarn und Partner (HZP)](https://www.hzp.ch/), and [MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/research-and-cooperation/research-and-development.html).

**Leisure**\
I enjoy spending my free time outdoors hiking and snowboarding, playing volleyball, and traveling where [windy](https://www.windy.com/) takes me kitesurfing. I play the drums and like making music with others.
